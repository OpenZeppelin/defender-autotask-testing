# Defender Autotask Testing

This repository contains code to facilitate development and testing of OpenZeppelin Defender Autotasks.

Rather than creating Autotask scripts in the Defender Web App and then waiting for appropriate blockchain events
to trigger a Forta Sentinel, this code allows a developer to specify a range of blocks to use for retrieving alerts
from the Forta Public API.  Those alerts are then fed directly into the Autotask in the same format that they would
have if they were occurring live.

## Use of Jest

This code uses Jest to override the `defender-relay-client` module.  That module can be used to create a JSON-RPC provider
in the Defender environment, but because we are not running in that environment, we can simplify the approach by using a
standard ethers JSONRPCProvider instead.

The use of `describe` and `it` is currently only necessary because we are using Jest for the module override.


## Configuration

- Copy the JavaScript code from the Autotask `Edit Code` window in the Defender Web App
- Paste that code into a file called `autotask.js`
- Create a `development-config.json` file with the following entries:
```
{
  "jsonRpcUrl": "https://your.preferred.json.rpc.endpoint/with/api-key",
  "agentId": "0xFORTAAGENTIDHERE",
  "startBlockNumber": <integer_for_starting_block_number>,
  "endBlockNumber": <integer_for_ending_block_number>
}
```
- Create a .env file that contains the name of your discord webook and the url for it:
  - ex.) `FortaSentinelTestingDiscord = "discord webhook url"`

## Running

- Run with `npm test`
